# COVID-19 ModelHub

## What? - Introduction
The goal of the ModelHub is to have a standard repository of COVID-19 forecasting/projection models for South Africa. This forms an extension of the open covid19za project. This ModelHub aims to collect, standardise, visualise COVID-19 forecast models as well as the data they create. The ModelHub is inspired and derived from the UMass-Amherst Influenza Forecasting Center of Excellence based at the Reich Lab [COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub).

## Why? - Background

It is important to be able to compare and contrast the forecasting models. Further, an ensemble can be much better than any individual model. 

## How? - Contributing your model

### General information
* All models [hopefully in notebooks] should be stored in the [modelhub/notebooks/](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za/tree/master/modelhub/notebooks) folder.
* We have made available a template on starting your own model submission -> [model_template.ipynb](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za/blob/master/modelhub/notebooks/model_template.ipynb)
* We will automate the running of the model. All models will be run every night. 

### Model Settings

Each model should be able to predict up to X days ahead.
