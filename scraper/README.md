# COVID-19 South Africa Media Release Scraping Tool

A simple CLI tool that allows the user to scrape `http://www.nicd.ac.za/` for new updates related to COVID-19
The original intent was to scrape `gov.za` directly, however the site seems to be intermittently down.

The tool is written in Golang, and as such, is compiled into a stand-alone executable binary that can be run for a command-line on any UNIX based or Windows operating system.

To build from source, pull down the code and execute `go build` in the root of the `./scraper` directory.

## Usage

To user the scraper, simply run `./scraper` with one of the following arguments:
1. `./scraper nicd` - this configuration will retrieve updates from `http://www.nicd.ac.za`
2. `./scraped cov`  - this configuration will retrieve updates from `https://sacoronavirus.co.za`

## Examples
