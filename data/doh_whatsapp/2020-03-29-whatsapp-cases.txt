Current projections estimate that the virus could affect 60% of South Africa's citizens at some point, but not at the same time.
Most South Africans will only experience mild symptoms and humans are capable of developing immunity to the virus.

The National Department of Health will now be releasing results as they are submitted by both private and public laboratories. In instances where NDOH confirmatory tests yield different results, the public will be duly informed.

TEST RESULTS OF CITIZENS REPATRIATED FROM WUHAN:
All the citizens from Wuhan were tested and their results came back negative for COVID-19.
They will continue to be kept in quarantine for the prescribed period and will thereafter be reunified with the community.
