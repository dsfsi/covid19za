The rate of spread of the infection is increasing, however this should not prompt a panic response.
What is of paramount importance is strive to flatten the curve, by slowing down the rate of spread.

Current Status of Cases of COVID-19 in South Africa
20 MARCH 2020 - 17:18pm

Total cases: 202
52 New cases
1 Full recovery (Confirmed Negative and cleared for returning home)  
0 Deaths

The breakdown per province of total infections is as follows:
Gauteng: 109
Western Cape: 57
KwaZulu-Natal: 23
Mpumalanga: 5
Limpopo: 1
Free State: 7

Current projections estimate that the virus could effect 60% of South Africa's citizens at some point, but not at the same time.
Most South Africans will only experience mild symptoms and humans are capable of developing immunity to the virus.

The National Department of Health will now be releasing results as they are submitted by both private and public laboratories. In instances where NDOH confirmatory tests yield different results, the public will be duly informed.

TEST RESULTS OF CITIZENS REPATRIATED FROM WUHAN:
All the citizens from Wuhan were tested and their results came back negative for COVID-19.
They will continue to be kept in quarantine for the prescribed period and will thereafter be reunified with the community.
