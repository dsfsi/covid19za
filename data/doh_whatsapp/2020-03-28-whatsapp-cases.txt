Current Status of Cases of COVID-19 in South Africa
28 MARCH 2020 - 20:37PM

Current total cases: 1187
New Cases: 17

We must outrightly state that these numbers do not indicate a reduction in the number of infections. It is merely a reflection of positive results that were received, verified and ready for todayâ€™s reporting.

The breakdown per province of total infections is as follows:
GAUTENG: 533
WESTERN CAPE: 271
KWAZULUâ€“NATAL: 156
FREE STATE: 68
NORTH WEST: 6
MPUMALANGA:1 0
LIMPOPO:  11
EASTERN CAPE: 10
NORTHERN CAPE: 5
UNALLOCATED: 117

The National Department of Health will now be releasing results as they are submitted by both private and public laboratories. In instances where NDOH confirmatory tests yield different results, the public will be duly informed.

TEST RESULTS OF CITIZENS REPATRIATED FROM WUHAN:
COVID-19 tests were conducted. They all came out negative. We are very pleased to report to South Africans that these citizens conducted their second test in preparation for their exit. These have all come out negative. They are therefore being prepared for vacating the Ranch Hotel.

Current projections estimate that the virus could effect 60% of South Africa's citizens at some point, but not at the same time.
Most South Africans will only experience mild symptoms and humans are capable of developing immunity to the virus.
