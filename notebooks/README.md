How to update the **Coronavirus - Comparing South Africa Cases to other Countries** visual



For the international numbers, the file used here is sourced from this GitHub repo [CSSE at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv).

The visual was created using RStudio and the tidyverse and rmarkdown packages. 

## Notebooks for analysis and modelling
This folder contains notebooks for analysis and modelling of the COVID-19 data. Some use the data in the repo, some fetch data from external data.

## Where do I start?
### Running the notebooks
You can pull the repo and then run the notebooks and make adjustments as I need. 

### Getting ideas
See the great resource from fastai on different analysis and modelling notebooks. [URL](https://covid19dashboards.com/)

### TODO
Have simple link to mybinder for all notebooks
